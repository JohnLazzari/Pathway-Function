Model Training Log

9/14 - added tonic input to str, alm, and thalamus. Training using SAC algorithm and constant alpha. Input into motor cortex only.git
    Going to train to see how it performs with tonic input. Then will test the policy replay load in

9/15 - continue training using buffer . Note: model saved in 9/14 but visualizations in 9/15

9/23 Still having difficulties loading in buffer. 100 time step may be too long. try different update rule during that period to make 
loss dependent on activity only.
